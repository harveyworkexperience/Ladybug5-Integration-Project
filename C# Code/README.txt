This folder contains all files created when investigating using C# to control the Ladybug directly via a custom application.

The main files are:

    ladybugExp1: The main application used to test methods controlling the camera. Currently nonfunctional but contains several useful subfunctions.
    rawImageGrab: Another attempt to make the Ladybug capture and save 6 images


Other files are smaller projects used to test ideas in isolation before attempting to use them in the application proper
