 * @defgroup LadybugImageAdjustment_cs LadybugImageAdjustment.cs
 * 
 *  LadybugImageAdjustment.cs
 *
 *
 *      This file defines the needed to adjust image that were not adjusted on camera.
 *
 *      This is the case for Ladybug5 when the data format is either of the 
 *      following formats:
 *      - Raw12
 *      - Raw16
 *      - JPEG12 
 *
 *      The image adjustment step happens as part of ladybugConvertImage().
 *      It happens after JPEG decompression (if required) and debayering.  
 *      If the user does not set an adjustment, a default adjustment will be applied. 
 *
 *      The software adjustment can be disabled or modified by calling 
 *      ladybugSetAdjustmentParameters() which will apply on future images.
 *
 *      This feature gives a lot of power for image post-processing.
 *
 *  If your C# project uses Ladybug SDK's post adjustment functions, this file
 *  must also be added to your project along with Ladybug_Managed.cs.
 *
 *  We welcome your bug reports, suggestions, and comments: 
 *  www.ptgrey.com/support/contact
