        /**
         * Initializes the context and opens the stream file(s) for reading.
         * Sets the current reading position to the first image in the stream.
         *
         * If an error is detected in the stream file, such as a corrupted header
         * due to power failure, this function returns LADYBUG_CORRUPTED_PGR_STREAM.
         *
         * The Ladybug library reads all the stream files that share the same base
         * name as specified by path. The last three digits of the 
         * name of the first opened stream file are always "000".
         *
         * For streams that require post-processing (e.g. Ladybug5 12-bit streams),
         * this function will attempt to open the matching XML file that contains
         * the post-processing settings. For example, if the stream filename is
         * "myStream-000001.pgr", then the XML file to be loaded is named 
         * "myStream-000.xml".

         * If a XML file is not present, it will be automatically created for the 
         * entire stream, with each image containing default settings.
         *
         * Example:
         *   If path is "c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000002.pgr" or
         *   "c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000010.pgr", the library will initialize and 
         *   read file "c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000000.pgr" and all the files that 
         *   share the same base name "c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000":
         *   - c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000000.pgr,
         *   - c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000001.pgr,
         *   - c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000002.pgr,
         *   - ...
         *   - c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000030.pgr,
         *   If applicable, the XML file will be c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000.xml.
         *
         * If an application calls ladybugInitializeStreamForReading(context, 
         * "d:\\ladybug\\lb2-003002.pgr"), the following stream files will be
         * initialized for reading:
         * - d:\\ladybug\\lb2-003000.pgr,
         * - d:\\ladybug\\lb2-003001.pgr,
         * - d:\\ladybug\\lb2-003002.pgr,
         * If applicable, the XML file will be d:\\ladybug\\lb2-003.xml.
         *
